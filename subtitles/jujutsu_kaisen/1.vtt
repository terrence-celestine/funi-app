00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.540
Morning.

2
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.120
So which one are you right now?

3
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.090
Aren't you...

4
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.720
Gojo Satoru.

5
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.090
I teach first-years at Jujutsu Tech.

6
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.450
Jujutsu?

7
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.010
Fushiguro...

8
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.320
My friends!

9
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.810
What the hell is this?

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740
I'm not sure you should be worrying about others,

11
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.520
Itadori Yuji.

12
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.110
It's been decided that you are to be secretly executed.

Itadori

1422
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.660
Hello, Sugisawa Hospital.

1423
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.710
Oh, this is Itadori.

1424
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.110
I just called earlier.

1425
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.430
Yes.

1426
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.460
Yeah.

1427
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.460
I'm sorry to keep calling but,

1428
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.220
how is my grandpa doing?

1429
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.250
Huh? I thought they already told you.

1430
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.490
Oh, please hold on. I'll go ask myself.

1431
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.040
Mr. Itadori never uses his call button.

1432
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.980
It's actually scary that he doesn't.

1433
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.980
Mr. Itadori, you have a phone call.

1434
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.950
Yuji is asking if you want him to bring any—

1435
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.200
Leave me alone!

1436
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.700
Tell him not to come!

1437
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.950
He should go to his club! His club!

1438
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.550
What? What's going on?

1439
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.980
Well, you heard him.

1440
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.420
What club are you in, Yuji?

1441
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.890
Yeah, I heard.

1442
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.210
I'll come by tomorrow evening.

1443
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.540
Miyashiro Prefectural Sugisawa Third High School

1444
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.580
They're keeping a cursed object in a place like this?

1445
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.020
Could they be any more stupid?

1446
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.120
There's nothing here.

1447
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.030
Huh?

1448
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.100
The Stevenson screen's empty.

1449
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.270
For real? That's hilarious!

1450
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.770
Maybe it took a nighttime stroll.

1451
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.040
I'm gonna punch you.

1452
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.370
Well, no going home until it's recovered, okay?

1453
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.010
I'm gonna hit him for real this time.

1454
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.770
It's about time. Are we really doing this?

1455

1524
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.790
they heard mysterious sounds and voices coming from the field.

1525

Hm?

1765
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:53.190

1766
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:53.190
Be careful because they can be carriers of

animals and humans!

1768
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:53.190

1769

So what?!

1775
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.080
The occult club is trying to uncover occult activity, so it's still a proper activity report!

1776

This isn't some kid's game!

1777
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.180
Besides, the problem here is you, Itadori Yuji!

1778
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.380
You're registered with track and field, not the occult club.

1779
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.050
So this club doesn't even have the three members required to be a club!

1780
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.510
Not Enough Members

Itadori

1793
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.560
No, I'm sure I wrote down the occult club.

1794
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.560
I rewrote it!

1795
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.990
The track and field coach, Takagi?!

1796
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.940
Itadori, we need you for conquering the nationals!

1797
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.610
Here's a teacher more problematic than the students.

1798
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.170
Give it a break! How many times do I have to refuse?

1799
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.770
No can do!

1800
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.570
Why not?!

1801
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.620
However, I'm not some monster.

1802
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.990
If you can beat me, I'll give up on you.

1803
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.500
Let's settle it fair and square on the track!

1804
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.900
Now that's interesting!

1805
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.170
You're on!

1806

1828
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.500
Track and Field Coach

1829
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.500

1833
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.540
Itadori

1834
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.580
Track and Field Coach

1835
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.580
Itadori

1836
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.580
Takagi

1837
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.630
Track and Field Coach

1838
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.630
Itadori

1839
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.630
Takagi

1840
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.840

Takagi

1842

Itadori

1843
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.850
How fair and square is it
to rewrite a student's club application?

1844
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.910
Something's off about this rugby field.

1845
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.060
Is there a dead body buried here or something?

1846
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.980
Even if there is,

1847
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.150
I'm surprised to see one this high-leveled.

1848
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.620
That's probably a grade 2 curse.

1849
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.530
Must be that cursed object's influence.

1850
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.870
Damn it.

1851
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.160
Its presence is too big to pin down.

1852
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.040
It feels like it's close, but it could still be far away.

1853
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.290
This special-grade cursed object is a serious pain.

1854
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.170
Who could have moved it?

1855
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.760
Where is it now?

1856
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.870
Check this out!

1857
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.250
Coach Takagi is taking on Itadori from West Middle!

1858
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.270
Whoa, what are they competing in?

1859
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.750
Hell yeah!

1860
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.270
Fourteen meters!

1861
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.840
Japan's National Record

1862
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.620
Wow, Takagi's still got it!

1863
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:55.320
Itadori! Itadori!

1864
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.860
What're you gonna do, Itadori?!

1865
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.130
Hey, is Itadori famous or something?

1866
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.650
They're probably tall tales,
but I heard he beat all stages of Ninja Warrior,

1867
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.890
and that he's the reincarnation of Mirko Cro Cop.

1868
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.830
But Mirko's not even dead yet.

1869
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.890
He earned the nickname "Tiger of West Middle."

1870
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.080
Lame.

1871
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.340
Hey, can I just throw this however I want?

1872
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.520
Yep. I won't call any fouls, so throw however you please.

1873
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.010
I'm sorry, I chose something that isn't your forte.

1874
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.550
Hopefully this will show you how serious—

1875
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.060
Uh, roughly thirty meters.

1876
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.050
World Record

1877
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.520
All right, I killed it!

1878
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.830
Tiger? More like, Gorilla.

1879
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.520
That was a pitcher's throw.

1880
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.020
Itadori, you'd do well on a sports team.

1881
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.110
You don't have to force yourself to stay in our occult club, y'know?

1882
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.060
Huh?

1883
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.960
But as much as you two love scary things,

1884
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.990
you couldn't go to haunted places without me, could you?

1885
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.560

We're scared because we like it.

1917
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.800
Besides, everyone in school has to be in some club, right?

1918
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.040
Yay!

1919
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.250
I could never keep this up.

1920
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.070
You don't have to do anything! You can be a ghost member!

1921
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.240
Occult Phenomenon Research Club

1922
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.540
We're the occult club, after all!

1923
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.760
I did say that.

1924
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.930
I've got my reasons, and I need to be home by five.

1925
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.760
So if it's okay with you, I'd like to stay.

1926
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.010
The occult club is really growing on me.

1927
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.520
Well, suit yourself. We don't mind.

1928
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.740
Yeah.

1929
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.550
That guy's incredible.

1930
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.320
He pulled that off without any cursed energy.

1931
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.860
I wonder if he's like Zenin.

1932
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.790
Crap, it's already half past four!

1933
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.280
Later, Coach. I've got stuff to do!

1934
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.440
The presence of a cursed object!

1935
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.210
Hey, you!

1936
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.400
How the heck is he so fast!

1937
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.290
I heard he runs the fifty meter dash in three seconds.

1938
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.720
What is he, a car?

1939
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.710
World Record 5.47s+

Saitou

1943
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.270
I told you not to come.

1944
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.760
Don't be buying flowers all the time.

1945
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.200
You always give me that.

1946
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.240
Besides, these aren't for you. They're for the nurses.

1947
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.680
All the more reason not to, you goof!

1948
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.490
And what happened to your club?

1949
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.970
Why aren't you at your club?!

1950
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.870
Oh, chill out.

1951
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.800
It ends before five.

1952
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.930
I wouldn't have come here if I wasn't so bored.

1953
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.130
Good.

1954
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.130
Since you've got free time, listen to what I've got to say.

1955
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.680
Not interested.

1956
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.180
Just listen anyway.

1957
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.160
I have some final words for you.

1958
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.560
It's about your parents.

1959
00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.560
As I said,

1960
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.140
I'm not interested.

1961
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.100
Grandpa, could you stop trying to act all cool before you die?

1962
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.600
A man wants to go out in style, y'know!

1963
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.790
Get a clue, you idiot grandson!

1964
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.070
Quit snapping over everything.

1965
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.030
You can just be yourself.

1966
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.850
Tch. You've had it too easy.

1967
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.540
Yuji.

1968
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.540
Hm?

1969
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.790
You're a strong kid, so help people.

1970
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.900
It doesn't have to be all the time, just whenever you can.

1971
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.400
It's okay if you feel lost.

1972
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.140
Don't expect gratitude in return.

1973
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.020
Just save as many as you can, even if it's just one.

1974
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.030
When it's your time to go,
make sure you're surrounded by people.

1975
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.690
Don't end up like me.

1976
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.520
Grandpa?

1977
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.940

Yes, what's the matter?

1985
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.990
Hello?

1986
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.170
Mr. Itadori?!

1987
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.660
Hello?

1988
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.140
My grandpa... is dead.

1989
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.570
oooo

1990
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.570
Notification of Death

1991
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.080
Okay.

1992
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.270
That's all of the necessary paperwork.

1993
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.620
Okay. Thank you for everything.

1994
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.340
Are you sure you're okay?

1995
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:25.800
Well, this is my first time experiencing
something like this so it hasn't really sunk in yet.

1996
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.510
But Grandpa would snap if I kept moping around forever.

1997
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.890
So I'll just have to laugh as I roast him up.

1998
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.250
Phrasing!

1999
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.860
Itadori Yuji, right?

2000
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.930
I'm Fushiguro from Jujutsu Tech.

2001
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.670
I'd like to have a word with you.

2002
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:44.360
Right now.

2003
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.990
Um, I'm in mourning right now.

2004
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.620
Sorry, but there's no time.

2005
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.370
The cursed object you have is extremely dangerous.

2006
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.980
Hand it over to me right now.

2007
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.370
Cursed object?

2008
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.770
This.

2009
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.590
Oh, yeah, yeah. I found that.

2010
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.510
I don't really mind giving it back,
but my friends were totally into it.

2011
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.250
What do you mean, dangerous?

2012
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:12.730
Nationally, the average number of unexplained deaths and missing persons exceeds ten-thousand every year.

2077
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.350

2080
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.470
38-year-old man accused of beating an 8-year-old's head against a wall arrested

2081
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.510
38-year-old man accused of beating an 8-year-old's head against a wall arrested

2082
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:11.560
38-year-old man accused of beating an 8-year-old's head against a wall arrested

2083
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:11.600
38-year-old man accused of beating an 8-year-old's head against a wall arrested

2084
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:11.640
38-year-old man accused of beating an 8-year-old's head against a wall arrested

2085
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:11.680
38-year-old man accused of beating an 8-year-old's head against a wall arrested

2086
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.540
Most of them are a result of curses.

2087
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.530
Curses?

2088
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.710
It doesn't matter if you believe me or not.

2089
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.020
Those are the facts.

2090
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.530
Moving on.

2091
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.030
Crowded places like schools or hospitals are likely to form pools of negative energy.

2092
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.070
Hardship, regret, humiliation.

2093
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.160
Mankind's negative emotions become the source of curses.

2094
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.000
That's why a cursed object is kept at such places as a protective talisman.

2095
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.500
The object you found is one of them.

2096
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.260
If it's protecting us, shouldn't we be grateful for it?

2097
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.630
Let me finish.

2098
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:50.600
A cursed object of greater evil is said to be a deadly poison that keeps lesser curses away.

2099
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.230
In reality, it's a bad practice that only claims to protect.

2100
00:13:54.020 --> 00:14:00.940
Over the years, its seal weakens and
it starts to attract curses to feed on them.

2101
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:06.540
The object you found is a dangerous one,
classified as special-grade.

2102
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.450
Hand it over before people start dying.

2103
00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.510
Hey, I already told you I don't mind.

2104
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.000
Explain it to my friends.

2105
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.260
It's empty?

2106
00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.170
I was just chasing the cursed energy lingering in the box?!

2107
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.420
Where are the contents?!

2108
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.390
Like I said, my friends have it...

2109
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:25.970
What is it?

2110
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:30.310
Actually, they mentioned something about peeling off the seal tonight at school.

2111
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.750
What? Is that bad?

2112
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.390
Bad doesn't even begin to describe it.

2113
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.530
They're gonna die.

2114
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.160
Phenomenon

2115
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.160
Occult

2116
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.160
Research Club

2117
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.910
I can't get it off.

2118
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.730
Did we really need to sneak in to do this?

2119
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.030
I'm turning on the lights.

2120
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.360
No! The atmosphere's important!

2121
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.280
Enjoying the thrill is in the spirit of the occult club, isn't it?

2122
00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.650
It's not like anything's going to happen, anyway.

2123
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.550
Oh, it came off!

2124
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.350
A human finger?

2125
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.350
Is it real?

2126
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.540
Is this...

2127
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.520
What is this?

2128
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.450
Do seals come off that easily?

2129
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.540
No, it's impossible for people who lack cursed energy.

2130
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.440
Normally.

2131
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.900
Go right! It's a shortcut!

2132
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.170
This time the object itself is too strong.

2133
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.230
That ancient seal might as well be normal paper.

2134
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:53.300
I still don't get all this stuff about curses.

2135
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.530
Where are they?

2136
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.760
Fourth floor!

2137
00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.800
What is this pressure?

2138
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.440
You stay here.

2139
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.150
I'm coming, too!

2140
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.440
It's dangerous, right?

2141
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.440
I've only known them a few months,
but they're my friends. I can't just stand by!

2142
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.700
Stay here.

2143
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:25.000
What time is it?

2144
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:33.050
The hour hand is at eleven.

2145
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.080
What is that monster?

2146
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.810
S-Sasaki...

2147
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.770
Iguchi? Thank goodness! Where have you—

2148
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.920
Help me...

2149
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.070
What time is it?

2150
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.030
The curse has been unleashed!

2151
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.990
Its presence is all over the place!

2152
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:57.780
Out of my way!

2153
00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.200
Demon Dogs!

2154
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.630
Go and feast.

2155
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.780
Am I just going to wait here like he told me to?

2156
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.630
What am I so afraid of?

2157
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.220
They're gonna die.

2158
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:20.890
That's right.

2159
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.980
I can sense death all the way out here.

2160
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.010
I'm afraid of dying.

2161
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.660
Was I afraid of it then?

2162
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.230
It didn't feel like I was, though.

2163
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:35.090
I cried because I was sad, not scared.

2164
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.990
Grandpa's death and the death I face now,

2165
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.490
how are they different?

2166
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.370
You're a strong kid, so help people.

2167
00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.960
More of those curses. They're close.

2168
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.470
Found them.

2169
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.140
He was short-tempered and stubborn.

2170
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.150
No one ever paid him a visit, but me.

2171
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.020
Don't end up like you, huh?

2172
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.650
That's okay, but...

2173
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.860
Damn it! Is it trying to swallow her along with the cursed object?!

2174
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.820
I'm not gonna make it!

2175
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.540
Itadori!

2176
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.170
I think you had a proper death, Grandpa.

2177
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.510
But...

2178
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.080
This right here

2179
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.970
is just wrong!

2180
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.370
So this is a curse?

2181
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.070
Not what I was expecting.

2182
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.670
Normally I'd be pissed, but good job.

2183
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.250
Why're you acting so smug?

2184
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:08.450
By the way, what's that munching on the curse?

2185
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:09.990
My shikigami.

2186
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.790
You can see them, then?

2187
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.100
Normally a curse can't be seen.

2188
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.190
Not unless you're on the verge of death or in special places like this.

2189
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.070
Yeah, that makes sense.

2190
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.720
I've never seen a ghost or anything before tonight.

2191
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.720
You're not scared, are you?

2192
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.710
Well, I was scared for a bit.

2193
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.690
But you know, people actually die.

2194
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.690
Huh?

2195
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:37.040
So at the very least,
I want the people I know to have proper deaths.

2196
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.540
Not that I really get it myself.

2197
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.120
Whoa.

2198
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.390
This it?

2199
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.400
Yeah.

2200
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.330
Special-grade cursed object, Ryomen Sukuna's finger.

2201
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.630
It's a miracle it didn't get swallowed.

2202
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.120
Why would anything eat it? Does it taste good?

2203
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:50.960
Don't be stupid.

2204
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.440
You'd do it to gain stronger cursed energy.

2205
00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.460
It's dangerous, so hand it over already.

2206
00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.110
Yeah, yeah.

2207
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:02.800
Run!

2208
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:12.890
Fushiguro!

2209
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:15.770
Nue!

2210
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.970
Damn it, I can't think straight!

2211
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.750
Itadori!

2212
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.890
Why don't you get it?! Just take those two and run!

2213
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.980
You're in a tight spot yourself!

2214
00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.420
Only curses can exorcise other curses!

2215
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.690
You can't beat it!

2216
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.360
You're telling me that, now?

2217
00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.320
In any case, you're gonna die at this rate!

2218
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.790
If I went home now, I'd be having nightmares!

2219
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.240
Besides,

2220
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.000
I've actually got...

2221
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Help people.

2222
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.290
...quite the curse myself!

2223
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.350
Dumbass! Hand it over to me or you'll be eaten too!

2224
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.030
Why would anything eat it? Does it taste good?

2225
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.310
Don't be stupid.

2226
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.400
You'd do it to gain stronger cursed energy.

2227
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.510
There is a way to save everyone!

2228
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.950
I just need some cursed energy, right, Fushiguro?!

2229
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:50.950
Stop.

2230
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.380
Don't do it!

2231
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.730
Ryomen Sukuna's finger!

2232
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.380
That's a special-grade cursed object!

2233
00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.790
It's a deadly poison! He'll die for sure!

2234
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.840
But there is a chance.

2235
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.300
A one in a million chance.

2236
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.550
Ah, I knew it!

2237
00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.630
Light feels best in the flesh!

2238
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.850
This is messed up!

2239
00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.600
A one-in-a-million chance worst-case scenario.

2240
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.570
The special-grade cursed object has incarnated!

2241
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.990
A cursed spirit's flesh is no fun.

2242
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.980
Where are the people? The women?!

2243
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.580
What a wonderful era to be in.

2244
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.550
Women and children are crawling everywhere like maggots.

2245
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.800
Marvelous!

2246
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.560
It'll be a massacre!

2247
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.390
What do you think you're doing with my body?

2248
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:22.380
Give it back.

2249
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.880
How are you able to move?

2250
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.420
I mean, it's my body.

2251
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.510
He's suppressing me?

2252
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.880
Don't move.

2253
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.600
You're no longer human.

2254
00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.180
Under Jujutsu regulations, Itadori Yuji,

2255
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.940
I will exorcise you as a curse!

2256
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:56.650
Episode 2
For Myself
